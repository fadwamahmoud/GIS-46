Exercises 4.1.-4.2.


In the exercises for this part, we will be building a blog list application, that allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet. For each listed blog we will save the author, title, URL, and amount of upvotes from users of the application.
4.1 Blog List, step 1

Let's imagine a situation, where you receive an email that contains the following application body and instructions:

const express = require('express')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const app = express()

const blogSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  author: String,
  url: String,
  likes: Number,
})

const Blog = mongoose.model('Blog', blogSchema)

const mongoUrl = 'mongodb://localhost/bloglist'
mongoose.connect(mongoUrl, { family: 4 })

app.use(express.json())

app.get('/api/blogs', (request, response) => {
  Blog.find({}).then((blogs) => {
    response.json(blogs)
  })
})

app.post('/api/blogs', (request, response) => {
  const blog = new Blog(request.body)

  blog.save().then((result) => {
    response.status(201).json(result)
  })
})

const PORT = 3003
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
})

Turn the application into a functioning npm project. To keep your development productive, configure the application to be executed with node --watch. You can create a new database for your application with MongoDB Atlas, or use the same database from the previous part's exercises.

Verify that it is possible to add blogs to the list with Postman and that the application returns the added blogs at the correct endpoint.

4.2 Blog List, step 2

Refactor the application into separate modules as shown earlier in this part of the course material.

One best practice is to commit your code every time it is in a stable state. This makes it easy to rollback to a situation where the application still works.

If you're having issues with content.body being undefined for seemingly no reason, make sure you didn't forget to add app.use(express.json()) near the top of the file.
